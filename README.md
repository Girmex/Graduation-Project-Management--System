# Graduation-Project-Management--System
This is my final year project. I have developed it with Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Express.js and MySQL database. It is my milestone in my web development progress.

#The Graduation Project Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the organization and
management of graduation projects undertaken by universities. It aims to streamline the entire process, from project proposal submission to final 
project evaluation, providing a centralized hub for students, faculty members, and administrators involved in the graduation project cycle.

#Key features of the Graduation Project Management System  includes:

Project Submission and Allocation: Students can submit their project proposals through the system, which allows administrators and faculty members to review and allocate projects to the respective students or project groups.

Progress Tracking: The system enables the monitoring of project progress, allowing students to update their project milestones, document progress reports, and share project-related files. Faculty members and advisors can provide feedback and track the development of each project.

Resource Management: The system may provide a platform for managing project resources, such as equipment, materials, and research databases. It allows students and faculty members to access and utilize these resources effectively.

Communication and Collaboration: The system fosters seamless communication and collaboration among students, faculty members, and advisors. It may include features like discussion forums, messaging, and video conferencing to facilitate effective project coordination and knowledge sharing.

Evaluation and Assessment: The system provides a framework for project evaluation and assessment. Faculty members can set evaluation criteria, review project deliverables, and provide feedback. It may also support peer evaluation and self-assessment components.

Documentation and Archiving: The system serves as a repository for project documentation, including project proposals, research papers, presentations, and other project-related materials. This ensures easy access to project history and knowledge sharing for future reference.

Administrative Tools: Administrators can oversee the overall management of the graduation project cycle, including user management, permissions, project allocation, and generating reports related to project progress, completion, and evaluation.
